									<h2>Don't Stop 3D</h2>
									<p>The game is set in a futuristic world where the player is a robot that has become self aware, and is now trying to escape this "testing factory" of some sort.</p>

								<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
								<p>This game started out as a solo project, which I made on a school course. This spring I had the opportunity to keep working on the game, with a group to aid me.</p>
								<p>On this current course my roles are <strong>Main programmer</strong>, <strong>Main game designer</strong> and <strong>Project lead</strong>
									<header class="major"></p>
									
									<h2>Features</h2>
								</header>
								<h2>Path Generation</h2>
								<p>At the moment the path generation is very basic, I've made some world "block" prefabs and those get spawned in a random order, which then loops. Current plan is to make more of those blocks, to easily add more to the experience.</p>
								<p>It would be nice to have a randomly generated map with more elements that get randomized, but I think that is outside the scale of this project for this school course.</p>
								
								<h2>Player mechanics</h2>
								<h4>Stamina</h4>
								<p>I've implemented a stamina system to the game, to make the player have something else to worry about as well, other than the map itself.</p>
								<p>Currently basic movement such as running and jumping don't cost stamina, while sprinting and wallrunning do.</p>
								<h4>Wallrun</h4>
								<p>The current wallrun system works well, but I'm wondering whether to improve the wallrun's path. Currently the wallrun stays at a certain height, and stops when either the animation is done, or the player jumps or decides to move away from the wall.</p>
								<p>I plan on making it seem more natural, in the sense that when the player jumps on the wall, the wallrun itself responds to the physics already affecting to the player. For example if you are already going down fast, you simply can't wallrun. Depending on how much speed the player still has going upwards, the longer the wallrun.</p>
								<h4>Sliding</h4>
								<p>While the feature is implemented in the game, the current map design doesn't have many opportunities for the feature to be used. I'm currently working on reworking the map design to fit the new movement mechanics and make it more challenging</p>
								<br><br>
								<header class="major">
									<h2>Project Goal</h2>
								</header>
								<h2>ICT Showroom</h2>
								<p>The main goal is to have this project ready when we are going to present this project march 5th in ICT Showroom public event in Turku, and should have all the features mentioned above ready by then.</p>
								<h2>Learning</h2>
								<p>This is a great opportunity to learn more about the Unity's mecanim system. Blend trees and animation events are something that could prove useful, to add more elements to the player animations.</p>
