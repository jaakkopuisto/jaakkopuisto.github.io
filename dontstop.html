									<h2>Don't Stop 3D</h2>
									<p>3D infinite runner -game, set in a futuristic world where the player is a robot that has become self aware, and is now trying to escape this "testing factory" of some sort.</p>

								<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
								<p>This game started out as a solo project, which I made on a school course last autumn. This spring I had the opportunity to keep working on the game, with a group to aid me. <br></p>
								<h2>Starting Point:</h2>
								<div class="image main">
									<iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQHSHb4PqTY" class="video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								</div>
								<p>As you can see, in just eight weeks the game went through a massive overhaul. On this project my roles were <strong>Main programmer</strong>, <strong>Main game designer</strong> and <strong>Project lead</strong></strong></p>
								
								
									<p>In this project I was responsible for..<br>
									<strong>Game design:</strong> Level designing, Player movement & animation, core gameplay, UI & UX, audio balancing<br>
									<strong>Programming:</strong> Everything expect one or two small scripts</p>
									<header class="major"></p>
									<h2>Game Features</h2>
								</header>
								<h2>Path Generation</h2>
								<p>The level constists of "block" prefabs (<i>Large chunks of playable area</i>) and those get spawned in a random order based on an algorithm. When the player progresses, those blocks get recycled to spawn again in front of the player, with randomness elements involved(such as: random block orientation) </p>
								<p>The level also gets progressively more difficult as the player progresses, to keep the gameplay interesting. This, and the random generation elements together make up for nice replay value for the player.</p>
								
								<h2>Player mechanics</h2>
								<h4>Stamina</h4>
								<p>The stamina system is a nice way to keep the player engaged with the other mechanics, and also to balance them so that the player has to think when to use the mechanics efficiently.</p>
								<h4>Wallrun</h4>
								<p>Wallrunning is a very key feature in this game, and it had to be done right. The mechanic allows the player to move in the map very elegantly, managing some hard jumps, and dodging all kinds of traps.</p>
								<p>The mechanic also opened up more variety in terms of level design, which all in all was the goal here.</p>
								<h4>Sliding</h4>
								<p>While the mechanic is implemented in the game, the current map design doesn't have many opportunities for it to be used. I'm currently working on reworking the map design to fit the new mechanic.</p>
								<br><br>
								<!-- <h2>Obstacles & threats</h2>
								<h4>Lasers</h4>
								<p>Helooooo</p>
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">Current state of the game & <br> plans going forward</h2>
								<p>The game is at a nice state currently: the features we wanted to have in the game are in, and they work really nicely. </p>
								<br><br> -->

									<h2>Project Goal</h2>
								</header>
								<h2>Showcases</h2>
								<p>The main goal for this project was to have it in a presentable state by 05/03/2020 for <strong>ICT Showroom</strong>, which is a public event in Turku. We succeeded in this goal, and got some very nice feedback from players, so I'm proud of the effort.</p>
								<!-- <p>From this point onward, I'm continuing to work on this project on my own, and I have some plans prepared!</p>
								<h2>Publishing</h2>
								<p>In its current state, the game is not yet ready to be released. I plan on adding many elements that allow the player to progress in the game: gain short-term powerups during gameplay (such as 2x score, better stamina etc.). I also plan on making multiple different levels, since the game has many mechanics that are very hard when the player hasn't learned the movement yet. </p> -->
